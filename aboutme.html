									<h1>About Me</h1>
								</header>
								<p>Welcome to my portfolio !!!</p>
								<p>I possess a deep passion for data analytics and an intense eagerness to transition into this field. Drawing from my experience in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors, I offer a distinctive viewpoint when it comes to data analysis. I am well-versed in Python, SQL, Tableau, and other analytical tools, and I possess strong analytical skills. Consequently, I excel at extracting valuable insights from data and transforming them into actionable suggestions. My unwavering determination to continuously expand my knowledge and thrive in the realm of data analytics motivates me, and I eagerly anticipate leveraging my expertise to facilitate business success.</p>
								<h2>Education:</h2>
								<p>I have earned a Master of Science degree in Business Analytics from Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business. This program honed my data analysis skills and fostered proficiency in various analytical tools. Prior to that, I completed a Post Graduate Program in Business Administration and obtained a Bachelor of Technology degree in Chemical Technology. These diverse educational experiences have endowed me with a versatile skill set that blends business acumen with technical expertise. My passion lies in utilizing data to drive strategic decision-making, and I consistently strive to enhance my abilities through continuous learning and professional development. Armed with a strong foundation in data analytics and a steadfast commitment to lifelong learning, I am prepared to make a significant impact in the field of data analysis.</p>
								<h2>Professional Experience:</h2>
								<p>Since my earliest involvement in the chemical and pharmaceutical sectors, my unwavering curiosity and fervent dedication to discovering transformative insights have guided my path.</p>
								<p>I embarked on this journey as a Section Head in R&D Adhesives, collaborating with cross-functional teams to address and resolve customer challenges. Subsequently, as a Senior Business Development Executive, I assumed responsibility for developing practical strategies and implementing lead generation systems. These invaluable experiences instilled in me a profound understanding of the significance of harnessing data to detect patterns and enhance operational efficiency, igniting my deep fascination with the capabilities of analytics.</p>
								<p>Motivated to explore the realm of data further, I enthusiastically pursued the Master's degree. This immersive program not only equipped me with a comprehensive skillset but also presented captivating project opportunities. Among these projects, "Data Analysis on NHTSA Crash Survey Data" stands out, where I leveraged the power of Python to unearth valuable insights regarding the distribution rates of crash fatalities. By meticulously processing and interpreting extensive datasets, I acquired a deep comprehension of the factors influencing fatal crashes and formulated impactful recommendations to improve road safety.</p>
								<p>With a firsthand understanding of the transformative potential of data analysis, fueled by passion, critical thinking, and a hunger for growth, my goal is to make a meaningful impact by harnessing data to drive insights and propel businesses to success.</p>
								<p>As I progress on my data analytics journey, I look forward to utilizing my skills and knowledge to contribute to the industry. I am excited to connect with fellow professionals, collaborate on compelling projects, and drive data-driven insights and business outcomes. Thank you for visiting my portfolio, and please don't hesitate to reach out with any opportunities, collaborations, or suggestions.</p>
